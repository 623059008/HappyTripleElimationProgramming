#### Barriers

Players may not be interested in algorithms, programming, and triplet elimination.

#### Game Impact

The happiness players feel

(maybe the spread on the social networks)

### Scenarios

Players find the triple same elements in a space structure to eliminate them with a limited stack to store extra elements.

In this process, there is a window to show the code panel and teach players some practical programming knowledge to solve questions.
