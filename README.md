## Happy Triple Elimation: Programming Algorithm
> Tempest(tar118@pitt.edu)

A game to teach players what is algorithm practise looks like.
A Match 3 casual game.
Hope you enjoy the HAPPY ELIMINATING and learn some algorithm knowledge.

### Players

-   Everyone who is interested in programming!
-   Everyone who is obsessed in happy eliminating, finding the triplet!s

### Purpose

#### Transform

Through this game, you may learn how to solve algorithm problems in programming, and feel how difficult it is to solve them.

#### Barriers

Players may be not interested in algorithm, programming and triplet eliminating.

#### Game Impact

The happiness players feel

(maybe the spread on social network) 


### Scenarios

Players find the triple same elements in a space structure to eliminate them with limited stack to store extra elements.

In this process, there is a window to show the code panel and also teach players some useful programming knowledge to solve questions.
